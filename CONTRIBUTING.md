### Code Contributions

At Erbsland DEV, we maintain high standards for security, reliability, and quality in our software. To ensure the integrity of the codebase, we do not accept pull requests by default. If you would like to contribute code, please follow the steps below:

1. Start by reporting a bug or suggesting a feature through the issue tracker. Alternatively, you can contact us directly to discuss your proposed contribution.

2. Wait for feedback from the maintainers or the community. This will help ensure that your proposed changes align with the project's goals and quality standards.

3. Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved, you may proceed with creating a pull request. Make sure to follow the instructions outlined in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section.

Please note that any pull requests submitted without prior communication or approval may be declined. This policy helps maintain the quality and consistency of the Erbsland DEV project. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated.

### Pull Requests

Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved, please follow these steps to contribute code changes:

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Compile and test your changes.
3. Write unit tests that test your added code through fully.
4. Commit the changes to your new branch.
5. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
6. Open a pull request on the original repository and the repository with the unit tests.

Please note: **Make sure your code follows _the exact coding style_ of the existing code.** Code that is not formatted as existing code of the project is a reason to **reject** your pull request.

## Style Guidelines

### Coding Style

**This project uses "Black" for code formatting.**

If you contribute code, you must run the "Black" code formatter with the parameter `--line-length=120`.

Please also follow these general coding style guidelines:

* Document all classes, methods and instance variables using doc-strings.
* Document internal and private methods if its use is not obvious.

### Commit Messages

When writing commit messages, follow these guidelines:

* Write concise and descriptive commit messages.
* Start the commit message with a capital letter.
* List *every* change of your commit, group the changes where possible.
* If you do extensive changes, split them into multiple small commits.
