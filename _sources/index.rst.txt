Welcome to Erbsland Qt TOML documentation!
==========================================

Welcome to the Erbsland Qt TOML Parser, a highly reliable and secure TOML parser that integrates seamlessly with both Qt5 and Qt6 environments. This parser is fully aligned with the TOML 1.0 specification and is also compatible with the current draft of TOML 1.1. Designed with a modern and clean C++ code base, it promises ease of inspection and understanding.

A distinctive feature of this parser is its inherent strict and dependable UTF-8 parsing, which operates independently of the Qt library. Beyond merely returning the data from the parsed document, our parser provides a value structure that includes the start and end locations of each parsed table and value. This feature is instrumental in generating informative and useful error messages.
